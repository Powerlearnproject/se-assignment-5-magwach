 Installation of VS Code
Steps to Download and Install Visual Studio Code on Windows 11:

Downloading Visual Studio Code:

I followed this link to the Visual Studio Code website.
I clicked on the "Download" button for Windows, which downloaded the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.60.0.exe).
Running the Installer:

I located the downloaded file and double-clicked on it to run the installer.
I followed the on-screen instructions:
I accepted the license agreement.
I chose the destination folder.
I selected additional tasks such as creating a desktop icon, adding to PATH, and associating with supported file types.
I clicked "Install" to complete the installation process.
Launching Visual Studio Code:

Once the installation was complete, I launched VS Code from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
Prerequisites:

I ensured I had administrative privileges to install software on my system.
Windows 11 was up to date with the latest updates installed.
First-time Setup
Initial Configurations and Settings:

Theme and Appearance:

I went to File > Preferences > Color Theme to choose a color theme (e.g., Dark+, Light+).
Font Size and Family:

I navigated to File > Preferences > Settings, then searched for "Font Size" and "Font Family" to adjust these settings according to my preference.
Extensions:

I opened the Extensions view by clicking the Extensions icon on the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
I installed essential extensions like Prettier - Code formatter, ESLint, Live Server, and Python.
Settings Sync:

I enabled settings sync by signing in with my GitHub or Microsoft account. I went to File > Preferences > Settings Sync.
User Interface Overview
Main Components of the VS Code User Interface:

Activity Bar:

I noted that it is located on the far left and allows switching between views (Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run and Debug, Extensions). Each icon represents a different function.
Side Bar:

I observed that it displays the contents related to the selected view from the Activity Bar (e.g., file explorer, search results, source control status).
Editor Group:

I found that this is the main area where files are edited. Multiple files can be opened in tabs and the view can be split to compare or edit side-by-side.
Status Bar:

Located at the bottom, I noted that it provides information about the current file, errors, warnings, language mode, and other contextual information.
Command Palette
What is the Command Palette:

I discovered that the Command Palette is a powerful tool in VS Code that provides access to various commands and functionalities.
It can be accessed by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P or F1.
Common Tasks Performed Using the Command Palette:

Opening files: > Open File
Running commands: > Git: Commit
Changing settings: > Preferences: Open Settings
Installing extensions: > Extensions: Install Extensions
Extensions in VS Code
Role of Extensions:

I learned that extensions enhance the functionality of VS Code by adding new features, themes, and tools.
Users can find, install, and manage extensions from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
Finding, Installing, and Managing Extensions:

I opened the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
I searched for the desired extension using the search bar.
I clicked on the "Install" button next to the extension.
I managed installed extensions from the same view (enable, disable, uninstall).
Examples of Essential Extensions for Web Development:

Prettier - Code formatter: Automatically formats code.
ESLint: Lints JavaScript and TypeScript code.
Live Server: Launches a local development server with live reload.
HTML CSS Support: Provides IntelliSense for HTML and CSS.
Integrated Terminal
How to Open and Use the Integrated Terminal:

I opened the integrated terminal by pressing Ctrl+ or navigating to View > Terminal.
I noted that command-line tasks can be run directly within VS Code, such as Git commands, npm, and other shell commands.
Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal:

Seamless workflow without leaving the editor.
Split and manage multiple terminal sessions.
Integrated with the editor's theme and settings.
File and Folder Management
Creating, Opening, and Managing Files and Folders:

Creating a new file: I right-clicked in the Explorer view and selected "New File" or pressed Ctrl+N.
Opening a file: I went to File > Open File or used Ctrl+O.
Creating a new folder: I right-clicked in the Explorer view and selected "New Folder".
Navigating files: I used Ctrl+P to quickly search and open files.
Efficient Navigation:

I used the Explorer view to see the folder structure.
I used breadcrumbs at the top of the editor to navigate the current file path.
I split the editor to view and edit multiple files simultaneously.
Settings and Preferences
Finding and Customizing Settings:

I went to File > Preferences > Settings or pressed Ctrl+,.
I used the search bar to find specific settings.
Examples of Customizing Settings:

Changing the theme: I went to File > Preferences > Color Theme.
Adjusting font size: I searched for "Font Size" in settings and changed the value.
Modifying keybindings: I went to File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts or pressed Ctrl+K Ctrl+S.
Debugging in VS Code
Setting Up and Starting Debugging:

I opened the file I wanted to debug.
I set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers.
I went to the Run and Debug view by clicking the Run icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+D.
I clicked "Run and Debug" and selected the appropriate debug configuration.
Key Debugging Features:

Breakpoints: Pause the execution at specific lines.
Watch: Monitor variables and expressions.
Call Stack: View the call stack and navigate through the code.
Variables: Inspect variables' values.
Using Source Control
Integrating Git with VS Code:

Initializing a repository:

I opened the folder in VS Code.
I went to the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+G.
I clicked "Initialize Repository".
Making commits:

I staged changes by clicking the "+" icon next to the files.
I entered a commit message in the text box and clicked the checkmark icon to commit.
Pushing changes to GitHub:

I opened the terminal (Ctrl+).
I used Git commands to add a remote and push changes:
      git remote add origin <repository-URL>
      git push -u origin master
